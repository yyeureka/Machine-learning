# Markov Decision Processes
3 Reinforcement learning algorithms: Value iteration, Policy iteration, Q-learning
are used to learn 2 MDPs: Frozen lake, Forest management.

File list:
openai: convertor to generate transition and reward matrix from OpenAI Gym examples.
_small, _middle, _large: three different sizes of that MDP.
_complexity: explores how number of states affects results.
_gamma: explores how discount factor affects results.
