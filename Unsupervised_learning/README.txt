# Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction
2 Clustering algorithms: K-mean, Expectation maximization
4 Dimensionality reduction algorithms: PCA, ICA, Randomized projection, Feature selection using random forests
are used to perform several experiments:
Dataset 1 - Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
  1. Clustering
  2. Dimensionality reduction
  3. Clustering on the results from step 2
  4. Run Neural network learner on the results from step 2
  5. Run Neural network learner on the results from step 1
Dataset 2 - Wine Quality-red
  1. Clustering
  2. Dimensionality reduction
  3. Clustering on the results from step 2
The codes are in dataset1 and dataset2 respectively.
